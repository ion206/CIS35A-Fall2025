readme.txt

In the main directory, four .java files are present,
NucleicAcid.java and HumanGenome.java have been copied directly from Assignment 2
DNA.java and DNADriver.java are the relevant Classes for Assignment 3

Becuase of the size of the outputs I've split testruns into two parts,
testruns1.txt holds the outputs to the testruns required by this assingment sheets
testruns2.txt holds the outputs to unique and personally chosen testruns to test edge cases and weird scenarios

There is also a handwritten class diagram included

Thank you :)
